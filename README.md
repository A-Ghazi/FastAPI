Password Generator API
Overview
This project is a simple API built with Python and FastAPI that generates secure passwords based on user-defined criteria. The API allows users to specify parameters such as password length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, and more.

Features
Customizable Password Generation: Users can specify the length and character types (e.g., letters, numbers, special characters) for their password.
FastAPI Implementation: Leverages FastAPI for high performance and easy-to-use API creation.
Built-in Validation: Ensures the user inputs meet predefined criteria (e.g., minimum length).
Auto-Generated Documentation: FastAPI provides interactive API documentation at /docs and /redoc.
